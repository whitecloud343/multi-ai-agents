# Multi AI-Agents

A framework for creating, orchestrating, and managing multiple AI agents working together to solve complex problems through distributed intelligence and collaborative task execution.

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides tools and infrastructure for building multi-agent AI systems where specialized agents can collaborate on complex tasks, each contributing different capabilities and expertise.

## üì¶ Available Agents

### Research Agent
The Research Agent can extract information from documents (PDFs, text files) and answer questions about their content:

- Document processing and text extraction
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Question-answering capabilities
- Conversation context maintenance
- PDF and text file support

**Usage:**
```python
from research_agent import ResearchAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = ResearchAgent()

# Process a document
agent.process_pdf("path/to/document.pdf")

# Build vector database
agent.build_vector_database()

# Ask questions
result = agent.answer_question("What does the document say about X?")
print(result["answer"])
```
